Welcome to **System Logs** â€” my personal dev journal, built to document the shift from creative delivery to backend systems, automation tools, and cloud-native workflows.

I'm **Mirko Trotta**, a self-taught full stack developer based in Germany. After years of working across content systems, campaign production, and frontend interfaces, I began focusing seriously on backend development and DevOps. At 43, this transition isn't a pivot â€” it's a **layered evolution** that reflects where I want to grow next: building systems that are scalable, automated, and useful.

## Why This Blog

I launched System Logs to document the work that doesn't always fit on a resume:

- Learning by shipping: backend APIs, cloud deployment, AI agent workflows  
- Debugging workflows and developer experience setups  
- Making automation feel like infrastructure, not magic  
- Writing clearly about technical growth â€” and making it real

You won't find clickbait or SEO fluff here. Just logs from a developer who's learning in public and building with intent.

## What's Coming Next

Over the coming weeks, I'll be sharing real posts and breakdowns from my current learning track and project work, including:

- Deploying containerized apps with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**
- My hands-on journey through **Azure** and the **AZ-900** certification
- Building multi-agent automation flows using **CrewAI** and **LangChain**
- Developer tools I've built or contributed to â€” and why they matter
- Internal dashboards, low-code integrations, and CLI tools for real use cases

Each post is grounded in practice, not theory. If it's not useful, I won't ship it.

## Why Now?

Because learning doesn't need permission â€” it just needs purpose.  
Because documenting helps me grow.  
And because I believe in clarity â€” in communication, in code, and in career moves.

This is just the first log. The system is now running.
