# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Multilanguage Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add i18n support with German as default, English as fallback, and Spanish and Italian as additional languages.
# Details:
1. Set up i18n framework with locale files for DE (default), EN (fallback), ES, and IT. 2. Create translation files for all static content across pages. 3. Implement language switcher component in the navigation. 4. Add language detection based on browser settings. 5. Ensure proper fallback mechanism when translations are missing.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all text elements are properly translated in each language. Test language switching functionality. Check default language loading and fallback behavior. Validate URL structure with language prefixes if applicable.
