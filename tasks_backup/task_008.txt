# Task ID: 8
# Title: Automate Blog Post Creation from Obsidian
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a workflow to automatically convert and publish Obsidian markdown files as blog posts.
# Details:
1. Develop a script to parse Obsidian markdown files and extract frontmatter. 2. Create a conversion utility to transform Obsidian-specific markdown to standard markdown or HTML. 3. Implement an automated workflow to move processed files to the blog directory. 4. Add support for Obsidian attachments (images, files) with proper path resolution.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various Obsidian markdown files containing different elements (tables, code blocks, images, links). Verify frontmatter extraction and conversion accuracy. Test the end-to-end workflow from Obsidian to published post.
