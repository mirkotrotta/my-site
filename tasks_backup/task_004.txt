# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Contact Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a contact page with form functionality and validation.
# Details:
1. Design and implement a contact form with fields for name, email, subject, and message. 2. Add client-side validation for all form fields. 3. Implement form submission handling (temporarily store submissions until backend integration). 4. Add alternative contact methods (social media, email) as fallback options.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation with valid and invalid inputs. Verify form submission process and feedback messages. Check responsive design on various screen sizes. Test keyboard navigation and accessibility.
